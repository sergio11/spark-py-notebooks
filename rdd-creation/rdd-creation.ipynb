An RDD is a distributed collection of elements. All work in Spark is expressed as either **creating new RDDs**, **transforming existing RDDs**, or **calling actions on RDDs** to compute a result. Spark automatically distributes the data contained in RDDs across your cluster and parallelizes the operations you perform on them."
